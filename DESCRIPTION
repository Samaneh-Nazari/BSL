Description: Provides a comprehensive and extensible toolkit for the Bayesian analysis of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The core functionality implements a novel and computationally efficient approach for structure learning, leveraging Laplace approximation to accurately estimate the posterior distribution over DAG structures. This package is designed as a foundational resource for causal discovery, enabling researchers to infer complex causal relationships from observational data.
